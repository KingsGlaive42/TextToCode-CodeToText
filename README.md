# TextToCode-CodeToText
These two programs compress and decompress a text file using huffman coding.
TextToCode.java converts a text file into a huff and code file.
Open TextToCode.java, and select a txt file that will be compressed. Make sure to put .txt at the end.
The huff and code files should have the same name as the text file.
Open CodeToText.java and input the name of the file you had compressed. No need to put .txt, .huff, or .code at the end.
The program decompress the .huff file using the .code file and return the original text file.
